# BAXY Themes for Libretro/Lakka/RetroArch
The folllowing files are the complete archive of the themes created for the Libretro project that end up in the Lakka OS and RetroArch App.
# NeoActive
NeoActive applies a subtle grayscale gradient toward the white end of the spectrum.  It is meant to blend the strengths of Kivutar's Monochrome theme and the RetroActive theme. 
# RetroActive
RetroActive was spun off of RetroActive Marked in order to provide a clean user experience. RetroActive icons avoid branding unless it's neccessary for recognizability.
# RetroActive Marked
RetroActive Marked was designed to give users an alternative to Kivutar's Monochrome theme. The Marked theme icons contain logos to represent the emulator core and stand-alone application projects. They also contain parody logos for the systems they represent. The labels are designed to mimic the style of the original system while highlighting the adaptive abilities of the Libretro project.  While the Marked theme was the original RetroActive design, in the Libretro codebase it is only implemented as an alternative icon set.
